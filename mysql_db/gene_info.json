    "Gene_ID": 128,
    "Gene_Symbol": "ADH5",
    "Description": "alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (class III), chi polypeptide",
    "Chromosome_Location": "4q23",
    "Taxonomy_ID": 9606,
    "Summary": "This gene encodes a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. Members of this family metabolize a wide variety of substrates, including ethanol, retinol, other aliphatic alcohols, hydroxysteroids, and lipid peroxidation products. The encoded protein forms a homodimer. It has virtually no activity for ethanol oxidation, but exhibits high activity for oxidation of long-chain primary alcohols and for oxidation of S-hydroxymethyl-glutathione, a spontaneous adduct between formaldehyde and glutathione. This enzyme is an important component of cellular metabolism for the elimination of formaldehyde, a potent irritant and sensitizing agent that causes lacrymation, rhinitis, pharyngitis, and contact dermatitis. The human genome contains several non-transcribed pseudogenes related to this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]"
